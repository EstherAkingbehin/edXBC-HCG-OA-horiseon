## Description 
Horiseon is a marketing agency site. Users can explore the site and learn how to improve digital marketing of their products. This project focuses on the landing page of Horiseon site. 

The essence of this project is to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. This is important because web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Refactoring this webpage will also be good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website. 

This project has increased my knowledge on HTML and CSS topic. I've carried out extensive research on Semantic HTML and how to apply them to increase SEO on a webpage. As a result, I have applied my understanding of this topic to make the code for this webpage more concise and easier to maintain while adhering to best practices.
